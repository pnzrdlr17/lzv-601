# [Lempel - Zev Visualizer](https://lzv-601.web.app/)

- Many a people especially for students, researchers, and others who are new to the domain of Information Theory have some difficulty in understanding and implementing the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) coding algorithms. These algorithms are widely used in data compression and have quite a challenging complexity.
- The Lempel Ziv Visualizer application aims to make the LZ coding algorithms more accessible and understandable to users.
- It presents with an interactive and user friendly platform for visualizing the LZ coding algorithms, which can be useful for learners and professionals alike.
- This can lead to more efficient data storage and transmission and open up new applications in the domains of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### FEATURES:
- Intuitive and easy to navigate user - interface, with clear visualizations of the compression and decompression processes.
- The web-application is responsive and minimalistic in theme and attributes.
- Text input to visualize the compression process through animation.
- Upload a file to compress and then download the compressed file.
- Files can also be decompressed back to the original data without any loss.
- Login-Signup authentication, along with sessions-tracking using JWT provide an adequate level of flow, security, and privacy.
