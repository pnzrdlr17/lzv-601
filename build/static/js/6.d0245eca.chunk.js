It is one of the most widely used compression algorithms and has been employed in various applications such as image, audio, and video compression, as well as in file compression software. It was a key component of the popular UNIX compression program "compress".'),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"cardx"},i.a.createElement("h3",{className:"this-h3"},"Working"),"The algorithm works by finding repetitive patterns in the input data and replacing them with shorter codes. It is achieved by building a dictionary of previously seen patterns, and then encoding the input data using the dictionary. It works independent of the distribution of data. The resulting compressed data then can be decoded by the recipient using the same dictionary."),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"cardx"},i.a.createElement("h3",{className:"this-h3"},"Pros"),"LZ Algorithm has been widely used in the compression of files, images, audio, and video. It has also been employed in network protocols, such as the Zmodem protocol for file transfer. Moreover, it has been the basis for other compression algorithms, such as the LZ77 and LZ78 algorithms, which have been developed to improve their compression efficiency and speed."),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"cardx"},i.a.createElement("h3",{className:"this-h3"},"Cons"),"Limitations, such as its inability to compress highly random data or data with no repeated patterns.
