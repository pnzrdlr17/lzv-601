It is one of\n          the most widely used compression algorithms and has been employed in\n          various applications such as image, audio, and video compression, as\n          well as in file compression software. It was a key component of the\n          popular UNIX compression program \"compress\".\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"cardx\">\n          <h3 className=\"this-h3\">Working</h3>\n          The algorithm works by finding repetitive patterns in the input data\n          and replacing them with shorter codes. It is achieved by building a\n          dictionary of previously seen patterns, and then encoding the input\n          data using the dictionary. It works independent of the distribution of\n          data. The resulting compressed data then can be decoded by the\n          recipient using the same dictionary.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"cardx\">\n          <h3 className=\"this-h3\">Pros</h3>\n          LZ Algorithm has been widely used in the compression of files, images,\n          audio, and video. It has also been employed in network protocols, such\n          as the Zmodem protocol for file transfer. Moreover, it has been the\n          basis for other compression algorithms, such as the LZ77 and LZ78\n          algorithms, which have been developed to improve their compression\n          efficiency and speed.\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"cardx\">\n          <h3 className=\"this-h3\">Cons</h3>\n          Limitations, such as its inability to compress highly random data or\n          data with no repeated patterns. In addition, the LZ algorithm is not\n          suitable for real-time applications or for compressing large amounts\n          of data. However, its ability to adapt to changing input data and its\n          relatively fast compression and decompression speeds really\n          out-weighs.\n        </div>\n\n        {/* <div className=\"cardx\">\n          In conclusion, the Lempel-Ziv algorithm is an important data\n          compression algorithm that has been widely used in various\n          applications for several decades. While it has its limitations, its\n          adaptability and speed make it a popular choice for compression tasks.\n        </div> */}\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"footer\">\n        Made with â™¥ by&nbsp;\n        <a className=\"a-tag\" href=\"https://github.com/pnzrdlr17\">\n          Fayez Anwar\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
